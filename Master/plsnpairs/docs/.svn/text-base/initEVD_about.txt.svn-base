About initial eigenvalue decomposition in IDL NPAIRS:

- see npairs_run.pro, npairs_svd.pro and ssm_cov_mat.pro

(i) npairs_run calls npairs_svd to do initial decomp. and create data matrix
(in new space) that gets passed on to later npairs steps.
(ii) Data is not mean-centred before passing into npairs_svd.  
(iii) npairs_svd calls ssm_cov_mat to create 'covariance matrix', 

***** BUT NOTE ssm_cov_mat just creates a 'sums of squares and products' (SSP)
matrix (i.e. doesn't mean-centre data M before calculating MMt)!!!*****

(iv) Then npairs_svd calls eigenql to calculate eigenvectors and eigenvalues
of the SSP matrix from (iii).

NpairsDataLoader.selectFeaturesEVD currently uses same method as above.
