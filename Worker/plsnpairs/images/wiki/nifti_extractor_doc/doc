#summary 8.3 Nifti Extractor tool

From the other tools drop down menu select 'Nifti image extractor'
With this program you can extract eigen images from saved NPAIRS or PLS result files.

= Extracting images from NPAIRS result files =
By default a view for extracting images from NPAIRS result files is presented when 
you open the extractor for the first time.

You can either fill out the fields manually or you can load a formatted text file that 
contains the entries for the fields. 

If you decided to fill out the fields manually there is the 'Select set' convenience button
that allows you to load a PC set by selecting a single member of a set.

Here is an example of the formatting a text file must have before it can be loaded:
/home/fletcher/workspace/data2/ATOL2/jul30_2010_y246_5cond$pc_NPAIRSJresult.mat,zs,CV2,2,6,10

The values are separated by commas. The first value is the path to the set of files you 
want to extract images from. This set must be a pc set and the pc number must be replaced
with the wildcard character '$'. The second value is the data type, where valid datatypes 
are zs for zscore,ac for average canonical, and fr for full-data reference. The third value
is where the CV value is specified and the values specified after the CV is where the pc 
files to load are specified. 

Generalized, the formatting is specified in the following way:
path to set with wilcard,datatype,CV#,pc1,pc2,pc3...

Once the fields are filled out you can either extract the images by either 
going to the file menu, hitting ctrl+e, or pressing the extract button. A dialog will pop up 
showing you the filename that the images will be saved under and from there you can select a
directory to save the files into. That is all there is to it!

= Extracting images from PLS result files =
You can only extract images from PLS result files one at a time. To do so, switch to the PLS
extraction view by clicking "PLS Extractor" and press the 'select file' button. Choose a file
and fill in the appropriate fields and then hit the extract button. A dialog will appear with
the filename that the extracted images will be saved under and from there a directory should
be chosen by you to save the images into.
